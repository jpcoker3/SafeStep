# Make sure to check if you need to pull changes before working. 

## How to Use Github:
### Create an account
[here](https://github.com/join)

### Download Github Desktop on your machine. 
Simple enough. Just do it. Link [here](https://desktop.github.com/)

### Open up Github Desktop
should look like this:

### Clone the repository
All this does is copy all the files onto your local system so that you can add/alter anything you need.
NECESSARY. 
Click the button in the top left (Current Repository) -> "Add" -> "Clone Repository.

#### Choose URL and enter the following info:
* URL (https://github.com/jpcoker3/SafetyShoes)
* Path to the files (anywhere local is fine)
* Clone. ( press the button that says clone)

### Tada
You've done it! yay! your home screen should now look like this

### Verify folder. 
Double-check the folder that you cloned the repository to. All files should be present. 
![Local Folder Image](/Assets/Images/Local-Folder.png)

## How to make changes. 
Work through the folder as you normally would on a project, and whenever you reach a good stopping point or finish a goal, make sure to push your changes to github so that everyone can see/use your work. 

### As you make changes to files, your Github Desktop home page will look like this
#### IMPORTANT: MAKE SURE TO ADD A COMMIT MESSAGE (Bottom of image. BE AS SPECIFIC AS REASONABLY POSSIBLE

## Push Changes
Just committing your changes doesn't change it for everyone. Pushing takes your local files/changes and changes them online for everyone.

## How to get other peoples changes
I don't have an image currently, but basically, the push button will instead say fetch, and that pulls the files from online onto your local machine. 
It will be highlighted or something on your Github Desktop so it shouldn't be too bad.
